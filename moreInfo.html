<h2>About the Team</h2>
<p>
Just six teenage girls from Southern California who are all very different,
but all have a passion to create and help everyone live healthy lifestyles in order to achieve their physical and mental health goals.
<!-- In the beginning, the website was going
to be called Running Buddy, and just have the feature of finding someone to
run with. However we decide it would be best to incorporate mental health
into our website too. Thus, Wellness Buddy was born. -->
